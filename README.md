# brain-networks-across-the-web
Data across the world wide web ready to be downloaded for your brainhacking pleasure. An assortment of brain networks, brain data that can be massaged into a network, and other data helpful for brain network stuff.  

## Learn
Because networks can be confusing

* [A tutorial](https://www.dynamic-connectome.org/t/tutorial/) in connectome analysis: topological and spatial features of brain networks
* [An	introduction](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/files/2017/ED%20Courses/Course%20Materials/BrainGraphs_Fornito_Alex.pdf)	to	brain	networks
